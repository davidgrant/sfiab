<h3>Differences and Requirements for the new SFIAB</h3>

<p>The new Science Fair in a Box (SFIAB) version 3 is a complete rewrite of the
old SFIAB.  This was done for several reasons:

<ul>
<li>The size of the code base and the number of fair-specific features
(hundreds of them) was making it challenging to add new features without
breaking existing ones

<li>The number of configuration options was daunting and hard to understand.
The new version removes many little-used features to simplify and streamline
the configuration process

<li>The underlying code and database architecture was hard to adapt to modern
technology like mobile devices

<li>CWSF concepts like challenges and judging entire age categories were
hard to fit in to the existing code.  Supporting both the new challenge
system and the old division system would make the code even more complex and unmaintainable

<li>We actually want to help our regional fairs, rather than use all our free
time to maintain SFIAB.

</ul>

<p>Essentially, to use the new SFIAB, you must model your fair like the
Canada-Wide.  Many fairs already do this. 

<p>You are, of course, free to continue using the old SFIAB if the new one doesn't fit into your fair model


<h3>Detailed Feature Comparison, new SFIAB 3 compared to SFIAB 2 </h3>

<h4>General</h4>
<ul>
<li>Full mobile and tablet support
<li>Cleaner and faster interface
<li>Fundraising system is removed
<li>Translation system is removed (no French translation of SFIAB available)
<li>Multiple fairs per SFIAB installation is removed
<li>Full judging support and score entry for CUSP judging (see below)
<li>Automatic award download from linked regional/national fairs, automatic winner and stats upload.
<li>Judge and Tour schedulers rewritten, about 100 times faster now.
As such, the configurable effort settings are removed.  Only high-effort is available.

</ul>

<h4>Registration</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only open registration is supported (students and judges).  Password-protected and school-specific registration is not supported
	<ul>
	<li>Registration may now be opened for a single user (student, judge) after general registration closes
	</ul>
<li>Registration fee is per-student (or none).  Per-project registration fee is not supported
<li>Support for multiple users on a single email address 
<li>Project numbers are only assigned after the signature form is received
<li>Required vs optional information fields are no longer configurable
<li>Configurable registration-fee items is removed
<li>Students must register separately and one must invite the other to a project
<li>ISEF project divisions are used to match students with judges
</ul>

<h4>Setup</h4>
<ul>
<li>Age categories and challenges are configurable, but each age category must be judged together.  Divisions are gone.
<li>Maximum 2 students per project, not configurable.
</ul>

<h4>Judging</h4>
<ul>
<li>The only supported judging system is two-round CUSP judging
	<ul>
	<li>You don't have to use it.  You can let judges register and the judge scheduler will still assign them to teams and projects and generate forms for each judging team.
	<ul>
<li>The only supported judge scoring system is 3*scientific + 2*originality 1*communication.  Each of the three is scored using a number from 1-4, with low,medium,high for each number.
	<ul>
	<li>Again, you don't have to use this.  
	<ul>
<li>Support added to generate judging score forms and time schedules for each judging team and project
<li>Support added for disqualified projects and projects unavailable in specific timeslots (the judge timeslot scheduler will assign judges appropriately)
<li>Automatic generation of second-round CUSP judging teams and projects to judge
<li>Judge score entry system to determine winners in each category
</ul>
